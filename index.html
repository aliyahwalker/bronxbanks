      <p>The Bronx is an area that has historically deserted when they need help the most. This year another bank, Amalgamated bank of the West Bronx, permanently closed their branch.</p>

      <p>There were only two banks left in the heart of Bronx Community Board Five, Amalgamated Bank of 94 E. Burnside Ave. and Chase Bank at Five West Burnside Ave. Now in the last month of 2020 both of these banks have left the area.</p>

      <p>The issue started more than a few years ago and even more than a few decades ago, this is unfortunately a tale as old as time for minority majority areas. The Bronx has always been disproportionately neglected in comparison to the four other
        boroughs in the city. The Bronx has the highest homeless population, the highest amount of food insecure individuals, it is the poorest borough, <a
          href="https://welcome2thebronx.com/2020/10/02/its-official-the-bronx-is-the-dirtiest-borough-thanks-to-sanitation-cuts/">the dirtiest borough,</a> the most
        dangerous borough, and conveniently it is also the borough where a <a
          href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork,kingscountybrooklynboroughnewyork,newyorkcountymanhattanboroughnewyork,queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork,richmondcountystatenislandboroughnewyork/PST045219">
          majority of the population are minorities.</a></p>

      <p>The Bronx is similar to other areas where there are higher percentages of minorities than White people. These areas that are minority driven are historically disenfranchised. The Bronx's disenfranchisement can be traced bank to the
        70's when it was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-bronx-really-burned/">notoriously burning.</a></p>

      <p>Typically these regions are given the least amount of support from both the government and corporations. This historical disenfranchisement highlights this nation's underlying racist tones that leads to systematic inequalities. The
        banks leaving Community District Five is an example of this phenomenon.</p>

      <p>Kenneth Brown, the Bronx Community Board Five District Manager, states that the community board is "currently working on the accessibility of credit in particular banking."</p>

      <p>"Were a historically underbanked community," Kenneth Brown stated with a sigh, "and Amalgamated branch closed in the heart of our commercial district." "These bank closures has roiled the community."</p>

      <p><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/bronx-small-business-owners-reel-night-looting-and-vandalism">After the lootings on Jun. 1,</a> these bank closures feel personal to small business owners who are still trying to get back on their feet.
        Community Board Five has already been through a lot this year between having the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/poverty-pollution-neglect-bronx-coronavirus-formula-disaster/story?id=70084738">highest-per-case
          fatality rate </a>for COVID-19 in the city, <a href="https://www.norwoodnews.org/black-lives-matter-protest-held-in-morris-park-in-honor-of-elijah-mcclain/">the Black Lives Matter protests </a>that sparked unity in the Bronx, and the
        looting of 125 small businesses this summer, this just made matters worse.</p>

      <p>Jaqua Curiel, a resident of Community Board Five and a member on the board, who has publicly expressed her discontent stated, "I am outraged!" The focus of her anger is directed at Amalgamated Bank who she says, "abandoned the community."

      <p> Amalgamated bank is getting most of the backlash due to how recently the bank closed when the Bronx was already suffering this year.
        This small banking chain promised that they were dedicated to the Bronx when they arrived. Unfortunately, many feel like this promise was broken.</p>

      <p>Chase shut down in October of 2019 due to water damage when the bank flooded. Yet, they never reopened leaving community members deserted and with only one option to turn to in the hearth of the west Bronx, Amalgamated Bank.</p>

      <p>Amalgamated Bank's recent closure this year came as a shock to residents who received a notice out of the blue that their bank accounts will soon be closed due to the bank deciding to permanently shut down this location.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, on August 24th, the community protested both, Amalgamated Bank and Chase Bank for leaving the Bronx. This rally was led by Jerome Avenue Revitalization Collaborative (JARC) and Bronx leaders like Pierina Sanchez, a council
        member for the 14th District of the New York City Council. Sanchez is a lifelong Bronx resident and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/114060740328279/videos/605428363680251">passionately displayed her anger </a>at these bank closures.</p>

      <p>Concerned members from multiple community boards came to the protest and stood in solidarity with Community Board Five members and residents. <a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/finance/banks-close-branches-small-businesses-suffer">Over
          the last 20 years </a>banks have left multiple areas in the Bronx, highlighting that this is not
        just a community board issue this is a borough issue.</p>

      <p>Dr. Omotosho, the Chairperson of the board and the Immigration Committee Chair, has also expressed his concerns about the lack of banks and access to credit in this district and in the Bronx as a whole.</p>

      <p>"In the 21st century, economic empowerment of our constituency is a right, not a privilege," Dr. Bola <a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/west-bronx-community-protests-bank-closure-on-burnside-avenue/">said at the protest.</a></p>

      <p>Since this protest Amalgamated has responded stating that they remain "a dedicated bank for Burnside residents." Noting that their team has been helping "more than 1,000 Burnside customers" gain access to
        online/mobile banking and debit cards.</p>

      <p>So far Community Board Five states that Amalgamated Bank's solution is to offer an ATM to the district. Or if bankers want to access a teller, they can go to Co-op City, which is a two hour trip by public transportation. </p>
